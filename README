  -Statusmon working with DSM servers/buffers, can successfully read from
   remote buffers and display data accordingly
  -Made much more modifiable with run constants for quick changes

07-22-16
  -Separated statusmon into demo and run configurations
  -Buffer support added, successfully reads whether buffers are active and gets
   data from buffers, displays data.

07-21-16
  -All subplots ready to accept input from buffers
  -Cube and front face arrow are drawn on orientation 3D subplot
  -Position of orientation subplot and position subplot have been switched

07-20-16
  -Polar graph near complete, just need to grab values from buffer, then
   implement coloring and marker sizes based on depth and confidence.
  -Work was started on position graph, other lines can be plotted similarly to
   first one.

07-17-16
  -Began working with all the various layers in the package to lay out the
   interface, change colors/styles, and plot/annotate data
  -TODO ran into problem with plotting data on polar graph, wiped out half of
   the axes.
